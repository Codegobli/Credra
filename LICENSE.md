## Why This License?

Credra is a privacy-first crypto escrow platform designed to protect merchants from chargebacks and censorship. While the work is public and transparent by design, unrestricted commercial use isn't allowed until the ecosystem and protocol mature.

This model ensures:
- Builders can study, audit, and contribute
- Bad actors can‚Äôt prematurely commercialize
- The project remains aligned with its values
